### C#_Projects

- **Role**
  * Developer
  
- **Project Overview**
  * I worked on the projects so I can gain C# knowledge.
  
- **Skills**
  * Learned how to use C# in order to create applications with useful user interfaces.

- *C# Project1*
  * There are three seating categories at an athletic stadium. For a baseball game, Class
A seats cost $15 each, Class B seats cost $12 each, and Class C seats cost $9 each.
Create an application that allows the user to enter the number of tickets sold for
each class. The application should be able to display the amount of income generated
from each class of ticket sales and the total revenue generated.

- *C# Project2*
  * Create an application that stores data in three employee objects and displays the data for 
  each employee on the screen.

- *C# Project3*
  * In the English measurement system, 1 yard equals 3 feet and 1 foot equals 12 inches.
Use this information to create an application that lets the user convert distances to
and from inches, feet, and yards.

- *C# Project4*
  * Create an application that predicts the approximate size of a population of organisms.
  This application should use text boxes to allow the user to enter the starting number of organisms,
the average daily population increase (as a percentage) and the number of days the organisms will be left
to multiply.

- *C# Project5*
  * Create an application that creates an object of the ProductionWorker class and lets
the user enter data for each of the object’s properties. Retrieve the object’s properties
and display their values.
